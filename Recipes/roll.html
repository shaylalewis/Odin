    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1/2 cup whole milk, warmed to 120 to 130 degrees F (49 to 54 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons rapid rise yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dried chives</li>
        <li>1 cup full fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make the dinner rolls</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir together warm milk, pinch of sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Allow to sit in a warm place until yeast begins to foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, chives, salt, onion powder, and black pepper until combined. Add in yeast mixture, sour cream, olive oil, and eggs and mix until combined. Gradually mix in another 1 to 1 1/2 cups flour until mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until mixture is smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes, adding more flour as needed to keep dough from sticking. Cover dough, and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grease a 10-inch cast iron skillet with olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>After the dough has rested, divide it evenly into 14 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place into the skillet. Place 10 rolls around the outside of the pan, and 4 in the middle; they will be a bit snug. Cover rolls loosely with a greased piece of plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are golden brown on top and sound hollow when tapped, 25 to 30 minutes. If desired, brush the tops of the warm rolls with extra olive oil or butter and sprinkle with a few extra chives. Allow rolls to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
